Maxx Mai Card Assignment (twoday takehome)
Build a proofofconcept that shows you can wire a small MongoDBbacked API, parse Gmail
estatements and return a “best card” prediction.
Scope – deliver only these two pieces
1. Mini prediction engine
o Reads exactly three hardcoded cards from a YAML/JSON in the repo.
o POST /recommend accepts a spends JSON and returns the top card name.
2. Gmail parsing demo
o OAuth flow to connect a Gmail test account.
o Pull one recent estatement email, extract the PDF or text body.
o Store the user profile, preferences and parsed statement data in MongoDB so
the mini engine can run on it.

Minimum tech expectations
 Backend: FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT guard.
 Frontend: One React or Next.js page for login + spends form (no fancy styling
needed).
 Security: HTTPS (selfsigned is fine). Keep secrets in .env and out of Git.
 README: Clear local setup steps + 2 curl examples.
Deliverables
 GitHub repo link (public or inviteonly).
 Short Loom (≤ 3 min) showing
a) Gmail auth, b) data stored, /recommend call and JSON reply, c) scroll through the
README to show setup steps + curl examples
